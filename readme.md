***A Infinite Elevator Generator***
*Have you ever played The Infinite Elevator on roblox?*
**this project is that but in python**
note: I am horrible at coding and have learned coding over the past week or two, so don't get mad that a person whom lost 7/8th of their brain could code better than me
Features:
 - ""procedural generation"" (not really, or someting, I don't know)
 - infinite playability (not really but ok)
 - procedural floor and room generation (I already said it but ***ok***)
 - that's about it (wow this is shitty)
planned features:
- NPC's
- Graphics {2d at first, 3d *maybe*} (this is probably not gonna happen)
- greater story generation
- Greater Dialogue
- better re-playability
- actual music (really bro???)
