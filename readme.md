**Procedurally-generated Infinite Elevator (story)**

a procedurally generated (if you can call it that) story generator set inside of an elevator, that's about it. This is based off of 'Briery' a old project that I'm still *working* on.

Note: I am horrible at coding and have learned coding over the past week or two, so don't get mad that a person who lost 7/8th of their brain could code better than me.

Features:
- "Procedural generation" (not really, or something, I don't know)
- Infinite playability (not really but okay)
- Procedural floor and room generation (I already said it but **okay**)
- That's about it (wow, this is shitty)

Planned features:
- NPC's
- Graphics (2D at first, 3D *maybe*) (this is probably not gonna happen)
- Greater story generation
- Greater dialogue
- Better replayability
- Actual music (really bro???)
